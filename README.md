# deno-oak-example

First Deno + Oak application stolen from Internet and tweaked so that it actually works.

* Inspired by an [article A complete guide to deno and oak](https://medium.com/nybles/a-complete-guide-to-deno-and-oak-with-authentication-using-bcrypt-and-djwt-with-mongodb-as-cbe4b604de9f) (this is where I took the code from)
* uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript (which allowed me to clean up code and fix strange errors)
* uses [AloeDB](https://github.com/Kirlovon/AloeDB) because I didn't want to install Mongo for this excercise

Initial commit is just the article code modified and ported to TS.
